# hello-world

Greetings!

My name is Adam and I'm an aspiring software engineer. I wrote my first 'hello world' when I was just a kid, but for some reason I largely forgot about computers in my teenage years and wend into mechanical engineering instead. I even did a Master's.

I've always been a software geek though. I spent my first (boring) co-op term learning about all things Linux, and have been using it exclusively on my home machine since about 2003. As a broke student, the world of open-source software was jaw-dropping, allowing me to tinker to my heart's content with fully-capable tools. I spent countless hours building and breaking things.

In terms of development, luckily I've had jobs where either appropriate software didn't exist, or was too huge and expensive to justify the purchase for the small slice we needed. So I had the opportunity to grow my coding skillset over the years, at first with small things like Excel macros but soon up to desktop and intranet applications that do a large portion of my tasks for me. 

Recently I've come to the realization (or, more accurately, admitted to myself) that I like the software side far more than the mechanical. I know that having a Master's in mechanical engineering is not a bad thing, but I do occasionally kick myself for not realizing/admitting this earlier. 

So, how does a mechanical engineer with ten years' experience make the transition into the software world? Let's find out...
